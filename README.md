# Welcome to Bart-Live 2.0!

- This is a Rails 7 application using the most current version of Ruby 3, designed for Bay area Bart commuters. The inspiration for this project came from a desire to spend less time waiting for Bart trains and more time on everything else.  I have been able to use it to consistently walk into any Bart Station right as the train was pulling up.
- Working on it also helps to keep my coding skills sharp and is giving me the opportunity to more comprehensively learn the front-end solution/libraries that now ship with Rails 7, called Hotwire (Turbo/Stimulus.js), which has been a pleasure to work with.
- I've been pleasantly surprised by how quickly I was able to practically apply the libraries to real world features, as well as how powerful and performant they are.  I think Turbo/Stimulus may even have the potential to augment React, if not replace it under certain circumstances, but we'll have to wait and see, since these libraries are very new by comparison.
- The application is being actively development whenever I have spare time. You can check out my progress at https://bart-live.herokuapp.com or http://www.bart-live.com, which will become it's permanent home.  Once it is further along, I will upgrade to Godaddy SSL certication, but for now if you prefer a secure connection, just use the first link instead of the second. 
- It is currently deployed on a low cost eco dyno until it gains some tranction.  If/when it does, I will upgrade the hosting as well as add background workers for some of the more advanced features I have already planned for it, like text/email reminders containing departures times for the date, time and station of your choice, as well other background features.
- I tend to deploy features in big chunks, but I try to deploy at least once a week.  Currently, the main map/live departure time feature is available in both minutes from now and clock time formats.
- Next will be a Navbar, closest station finder, along with user sign up/authentication.  I have some fun ideas for what users will have access to once logged in, but I don't want to spoil too many of the surprises. ðŸŽ‰
- Check back regularly for updates!
